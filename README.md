# BFA Sensor Fusion

This project consists of various sensor fusion algorithms in Python for orientation estimation.
Included is also a 3D visualization tool for quaternion data developed in the Unity3D game engine.

Below is a demonstration of `kga_quat.py`, based on the research paper "Keeping a Good Attitude: A Quaternion-Based Orientation Filter for IMUs and MARGs":
